# OpenRouter Stats & Cost tracking
Filter function for Open WebUI, which displays stats and cost tracking when using OpenRouter connection.

Utilizes [usage accounting](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/usage-accounting) which OpenRouter enables after sending the updated user input. This makes it possible to report the exact cost and remaining credit as shown on the [activity page](https://openrouter.ai/activity) on the OpenRouter dashboard.
